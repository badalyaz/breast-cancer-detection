## Goal
Our goal is to create a model that will be able to detect breast cancer from X-ray images. We use several Machine Learning techniques to approach our goal.

## Technical details


## Sample test
- There is a folder named Sample_data, where are 19 sample images.
- There is a folder named generated_heatmaps, where are generated and saved heatmaps for 316 images.
In folder Notebook there are jupyter notebook files containing visualizations and evaluations
- There is a file named [Check heatmaps.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/sven.badalyan/breast_cancer_gitlab/-/blob/workers_branch/HeatmapGenerator/Notebooks/Check%20heatmaps.ipynb) in the HeatmapGenerator folder. You can see how the Heatmap generator works.
- The file where we tune thresholds for density calculation is named [Threshold results.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/sven.badalyan/breast_cancer_gitlab/-/blob/workers_branch/HeatmapGenerator/Notebooks/Threshold%20results.ipynb)
- The file where we tune thresholds [Evaluate threshold results.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/sven.badalyan/breast_cancer_gitlab/-/blob/workers_branch/HeatmapGenerator/Notebooks/Evaluate%20threshold%20results%20with%20bins.ipynb)
- The file where we tune thresholds using bins [Evaluate threshold results with bins.ipynb](https://gitlab.com/sven.badalyan/breast_cancer_gitlab/-/blob/workers_branch/HeatmapGenerator/Notebooks/Evaluate%20threshold%20results%20with%20bins.ipynb)
There are also files in wich one can produce gridsearch in different types
## Example
Here is an example of the heatmaps generated by heatmap generator
